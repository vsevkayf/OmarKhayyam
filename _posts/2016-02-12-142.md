INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common vasculopathy categorized as
either non-proliferative (NPDR) or proliferative (PDR),characterized by
dysfunctional blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and diagnosed using fluorescein
angiography (FA). Since the BRB is similar in structure and function to the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and BBB dysfunction plays a key role in the
pathogenesis of brain disorders, we hypothesized that PDR, the severe form of DR,
is likely to mirror BBB damage and to predict a worse neuropsychiatric outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among subjects with diabetes 
(N=2982) with FA-confirmed NPDR (N=2606) or PDR (N=376). Incidence and
probability to develop brain pathologies and mortality were investigated in a
10-year follow-up study. We used Kaplan-Meier, Cox and logistic regression
analyses to examine association between DR severity and neuropsychiatric
morbidity adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: Patients with PDR had significantly higher rates of all-cause brain
pathologies (P<0.001), specifically stroke (P=0.005), epilepsy (P=0.006) and
psychosis (P=0.024), and a shorter time to develop any neuropsychiatric event
(P<0.001) or death (P=0.014) compared to NPDR. Cox adjusted hazard ratio for
developing all-cause brain impairments was higher for PDR (HR=1.37, 95% CI
1.16-1.61, P<0.001) which was an independent predictor for all-cause brain
impairments (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04-1.64, P=0.022), epilepsy (OR 2.16, 95% CI
1.05-4.41, P=0.035) and mortality (HR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.70, P=0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to confirm that angiography-proven
microvasculopathy identifies patients at high risk for neuropsychiatric morbidity
and mortality.
