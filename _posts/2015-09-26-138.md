BACKGROUND: Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are commonly used to rapidly 
reverse warfarin-associated coagulopathy; however, venous thromboembolism (VTE)
is an established adverse event.
OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for VTE AFTER administration of a
three-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (3F-PCC) for warfarin-associated
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients with a warfarin-associated
ICH who received a 3F-PCC at a single tertiary care hospital between 2008 and
2013. Outcomes were VTE events (defined as deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary 
embolism [PE], limb ischemia, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular
accident, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction, and unexplained sudden death) occurring within 30 days of 
3F-PCC administration. Risk factors in subjects with and without VTE
complications were compared via Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test,
Mann-Whitney U test, and univariate logistic regression as appropriate.
RESULTS: Two hundred nine subjects received 3F-PCC for warfarin-associated ICH.
There were 22 VTE events in 19 subjects (9.1%). Baseline characteristics of
subjects with and without VTE were similar. There was a significant increase in
VTE events in 29 subjects who were taking warfarin for a previous PE or DVT
(36.8% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.007; logistic regression odds ratio 4.455, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a prior history of PE or DVT who were given 3F-PCC for
warfarin-associated ICH were 4.5 times more likely to sustain a VTE within
30 days. A careful analysis of risks and benefits of rapidly reversing
anticoagulation must be made prior to the administration of 3F-PCC in this
patient population.
