projects:
- name: Tonsillectomy and Tonsillotomy in Children
  description: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tonsillotomy as compared of tonsillectomy in terms of the recurrence of obstructive sleep apnea symptoms at least one year post operation and to evaluate the safety of tonsillotomy as compared with tonsillectomy in terms of periprocedural complications.

- name: Predict Study
  description: A number of diseases that affect the cardiovascular system emerge during pregnancy, a physiological state associated with elevated insulin resistance. Dyslipidemia is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor. However lipid physiology and pathophysiology during pregnancy has not been studied extensively in large population-based cohorts. The main objective of the study is to strengthen and confirm the preliminary findings of elevated triglycerides and low HDL levels being associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and elevated triglycerides and low HDL levels during the gestation are associated with a high risk of developing dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome.

- name: Environment and Health in the Northern Negev
  description: Air pollution was found to be associated with cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality. In a series of studies we assess the association between air pollution and respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.

- name: Leishmania
  description: The purpose of this study is to assess the epidemiology of Leishmania infection in Southern Israel, identify spatial and temporal trends and changing distribution of Leishmania and to develop a rapid test allowing for real time precise diagnosis of Leishmania species.

- name: Fracture Prevention
  description: Osteoporotic fractures carry a major health care impact worldwide, manifest both in terms of early mortality, decreased quality of life and an economic burden. We assume that intervention with various forms of Fracture Liaison Service will reduce fracture rates by 25% and will be cost-effective. Our goal is to create a pathway for successful implementation of a multifaceted intervention for prevention of recurrent fractures.

- name: Stroke Registry
  description: Early diagnosis of stroke allows medical staff to provide treatment which reduces stroke related morbidity and mortality. The main objective of this project is to identify additional risk factor for stroke in order to raise the level of suspicion in the ED for stroke patients and provide with faster and better medical care.
