There is a full collaboration between SCRC and different departments within Soroka University Medical Center.  
Here are some of SCRC's recently active studies:  

<u>Medical Clowning</u>  
The use of humor is one of the milestones for “medical clowning”. This profession, established in the late 20th century is now an integral part of hospitals in the Western world. The primary objective of the "medical clowning" study is to investigate the effects of the presence of clowns on a child’s postoperative pain, and anxiety levels of the child and the accompanying parent.  

<u>Tonsillectomy and Tonsillotomy in Children</u>  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tonsillotomy as compared of tonsillectomy in terms of the recurrence of obstructive sleep apnea symptoms at least one year post operation and to evaluate the safety of tonsillotomy as compared with tonsillectomy in terms of periprocedural complications.  

<u>Predict Study</u>  
A number of diseases that affect the cardiovascular system emerge during pregnancy, a physiological state associated with elevated insulin resistance. Dyslipidemia is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor. However lipid physiology and pathophysiology during pregnancy has not been studied extensively in large population-based cohorts. The main objective of the study is to strengthen and confirm the preliminary findings of elevated triglycerides and low HDL levels being associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and elevated triglycerides and low HDL levels during the gestation are associated with a high risk of developing dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome.  

<u>Breast Cancer and Osteoporosis</u>  
Bone mineral density (BMD) is considered to be a marker for lifetime estrogen exposure. The primary objective of this study is to assess whether bone density is associated with a risk of subsequent development of breast cancer.  

<u>Environment and Health in the Northern Negev</u>  
Air pollution was found to be associated with cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality. In a series of studies we assess the association between air pollution and respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.  

<u>Leishmania</u>  
The purpose of this study is to assess the epidemiology of Leishmania infection in Southern Israel, identify spatial and temporal trends and changing distribution of Leishmania and to develop a rapid test allowing for real time precise diagnosis of Leishmania species.  

<u>Fracture Prevention</u>  
Osteoporotic fractures carry a major health care impact worldwide, manifest both in terms of early mortality, decreased quality of life and an economic burden. We assume that intervention with various forms of Fracture Liaison Service will reduce fracture rates by 25% and will be cost-effective. Our goal is to create a pathway for successful implementation of a multifaceted intervention for prevention of recurrent fractures.  

<u>Stroke registry</u>  
Early diagnosis of stroke allows medical staff to provide treatment which reduces stroke related morbidity and mortality. The main objective of this project is to identify additional risk factor for stroke in order to raise the level of suspicion in the ED for stroke patients and provide with faster and better medical care.
