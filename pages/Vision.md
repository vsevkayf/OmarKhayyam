Our mission is to lead and support clinical study from the very first step of the project- formulation of a scientific idea, through the data collection and analysis, to the final step - integration of the scientific findings into the clinical practice.

Our Goals:

• To enhance the clinical research infrastructure

• To provide logistical support to scientists involved in clinical research

• To provide an educational support in clinical research methodology based on the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICH-GCP and Israeli Ministry of Health standards

• To establish and develop collaboration between basic science researchers  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and clinicians leading adopting translational research approach
