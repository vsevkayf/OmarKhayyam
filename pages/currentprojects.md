There is a full collaboration between SCRC and different departments within Soroka University Medical Center.  
Here are some of SCRC's recently active studies:  

<u>Medical Clowning</u>  
The use of humor is one of the milestones for "medical clowning". This profession, established in the late 20th century is now an integral part of hospitals in the Western world. Studies investigating the connection between humor and physical health were initiated in the late 70s, and in 40 years of perspective, it is known is that humor has many positive effects.
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the presence of clowns on a childâ€™s postoperative pain levels as well as the anxiety levels of the child and the accompanying parent.

<u>Tonsillectomy and Tonsillotomy in Children</u>   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tonsillotomy as compared of tonsillectomy in terms of the recurrence of obstructive sleep apnea symptoms at least one year post operation - To evaluate the safety of tonsillotomy as compared with tonsillectomy in terms of periprocedural complications and to assess the rate of tissue regrowth after tonsillotomy.

<u>Predict Study</u>   
A number of diseases that affect the cardiovascular system emerge during pregnancy, a physiological state associated with elevated insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes while gestational hypertension is associated with an elevated risk of developing subsequent systemic hypertension. The third component of the metabolic syndrome associated with insulin resistance, i.e. dyslipidemia, is a well known cardiovascular risk factor. However lipid physiology and pathophysiology during pregnancy has not been studied extensively in large population-based cohorts. The main objective of the study is to strengthen and confirm the preliminary findings of elevated triglycerides and low HDL levels being associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and elevated triglycerides and low HDL levels during the gestation are associated with a high risk of developing dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome.

<u>Breast Cancer and Osteoporosis</u>   
Bone mineral density (BMD) is considered to be a marker for lifetime estrogen exposure. Some studies have suggested that a higher bone mass is associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. The proposed biological explanation is stimulating effects of estrogen on both trabecular bone and mammary cells.
The primary objective of this study is to assess whether bone density is associated with a risk of subsequent development of breast cancer.

<u>Environment and Health in the Northern Negev</u>   
Natural soils in arid and semi-arid zones are source areas for air pollution through emissions of dust-sized particles to the atmosphere. Some soils yet pollute even more because of disturbance. Soil-derived airborne particles (SDAP) may contain organic matter or toxic chemicals. Although the association between environmental dust exposure and respiratory morbidity exists, the rudimentary understanding of the relationships between SDAP and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and thus, socio-economic consequences, dictates the need for innovative and interdisciplinary quantitative-research into these issues. The overall objective of this research is to explore the impact of chronic and acute exposure to SDAP on COPD and ischemic heart diseases (IHD) in space and time in the Northern Negev.

<u>Leishmania</u>   
In Israel, Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused mainly by L. major and L. tropica species. Parasitological examinations performed in laboratory at Soroka University Medical Center during the last decade indicate an increase in CL incidence in Southern Israel and increase in L tropica infection. The disease has spread to new areas previously known to be free of infection. In addition, more cases, resistant to available treatment have been demonstrated, probably due to L. tropica in this region.
Our purpose is  to assess the epidemiology of Leishmania infection in Southern Israel, identify spatial and temporal trends and changing distribution of Leishmania and to develop a rapid test allowing for real time precise diagnosis of Leishmania species.

<u>Fracture Prevention</u>   
Osteoporotic fractures, including hip fractures, are common and a major health care issues worldwide, with increasing incidence with time. Every fragility fracture signals increased risk of future fractures as well as risk of premature mortality. Osteoporotic fractures carry a major health care impact worldwide, manifest both in terms of early mortality, decreased quality of life and an economic burden. We assume that intervention with various forms of Fracture Liaison Service, will reduce fracture rates by 25% and will be cost-effective. Our goal is to create a pathway for successful implementation of a multifaceted intervention for prevention of recurrent fractures.

<u>Stroke registry</u>   
Some of the preventable and non-preventable risk factors for stroke has been established decades ago, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, age and race. Early diagnosis of stroke allows medical staff to provide treatment which reduces stroke related morbidity and mortality.
The main objective of this project is to identify additional risk factor for stroke in order to raise the level of suspicion in the ED for stroke patients and provide with faster and better medical care.
