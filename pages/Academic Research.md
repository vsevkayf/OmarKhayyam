SCRC is responsible for the organization and supervision of research projects in different clinical settings.  

Projects can be initiated by either the hospital clinical staff or basic science researchers.

Another aspect of the Center's work is Translational research- from the basic science to the clinical medicine.  

For each study or trial a dedicated research team is assigned according to the protocol needs and may also include, study assistants, biotacticians, programmers etc working together with the project manager and the physicians.
